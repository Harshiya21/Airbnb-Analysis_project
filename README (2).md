# AirbnbAnalysis
    
    This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.

## Requirements
    
    1.Python -- Python: Python is a widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

    2.Plotly: Plotly is a Python module used for data visualization, offering support for various types of graphs and charts.

    3.Pandas: Pandas is a Python library commonly used for data manipulation and analysis, providing powerful tools for working with structured data.

    4.Streamlit: Streamlit is a Python framework designed for quickly building and sharing interactive web applications for machine learning and data science projects.

    5.Seaborn,Matplotlib: seaborn and matplotlib is a Python module used for data visualization, offering support for various types of graphs and charts.
## Installation

    To run this project, you need to install the following packages:

    import connection_string = "mongodb+srv://ammuharshiya2104:sDYAvikAUkjxrGqU@cluster0.fx9yxi1.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
## Project Workflow
    
    Step 1 :
    Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.

    Step 2 :
    Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary. Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

    Step 3 :
    Develop a streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps.

    Step 4 :
    Use the cleaned data to analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. Create dynamic plots and charts that enable users to explore price trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.

    Step 5 -- To create a Streamlit Application

    Note : You can check the .py file attched above for the code implementation of this streamlit Application.

    This project produces a dynamic dashboard using Streamlit, offering live geo visualizations and insights extracted from the MongoDB Atlas.
    
    Accessible through a web browser, users can navigate through interactive visualizations and explore various facts and figures seamlessly. This dashboard serves as a valuable resource for data analysis and informed decision-making.

    This user-friendly interface is powered by Streamlit, while Plotly's built-in functionalities handle the data visualization aspects.
